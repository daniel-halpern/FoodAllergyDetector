# FoodAllergyDetector
This is a project I worked on at the end of my senior year of high school for my Robotics and Artificial Intelligence class.

It aims to determine if a food is safe to eat for someone with specific allergies. What this app does is first classifies what food is in the input image using a CNN, then asks Llama 3 if this food is safe to eat if someone has these allergies.
